summary    : Typing Extensions â€“ Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python
description: |
    The "typing" module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5 on a provisional basis and will no longer be provisional in Python 3.7. However, this means users of Python 3.5 - 3.6 who are unable to upgrade will not be able to take advantage of new types added to the "typing" module, such as "typing.Text" or "typing.Coroutine".
